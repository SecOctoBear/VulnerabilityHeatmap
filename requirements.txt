# Specification

This file contains the specification requirements of the heatmap. 
These requirements will be implemented in `frontend/frontend.js` and automatically tested in the file `frontend/frontend.test.js`.

Data structure:
- we have N applications
- every application has an array of scans, and each scan correspondends to a certain calendar week (CW) and has findings (x critical, y high etc)

A user may select different rules or scenarios which define the rules for the visualization (i.e. the color calculation).

# Scenario "Default SLA"

## Req1:
Given an app has no scans at all there should be no heatmap line for this app.

## Req2:
Given there are no scans in a certain CW it should get dark red (one week without scans is a BAD SIGN)

## Req3:
Given WHEN THEN ...


# Which apps to display?

We may have 100s of apps, how should we decide which ones to display?
